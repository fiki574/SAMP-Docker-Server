- Must have complete server structure on Git repository, including binaries (executables, plugins, NPC recordings)
- No "scriptfiles" persistence, so once the container is stopped any log or similarly updated configuration/temporary/storage file is lost
- No support for "MapAndreas" or other big files (because Git doesn't allow it)
- No special image tagging/versioning except for usage of "latest" tag, so any older versioned images are removed and unusable
- No special implementation for private Git repositories that require credentials for to be able to clone the repository
- Mostly limited to integration with MySQL database, rather than SQLite, Dini, y_ini, etc.
